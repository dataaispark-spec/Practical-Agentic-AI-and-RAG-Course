# Module 26 — Production Evaluation



## Mission

Turn AegisAI evaluation into an engineering release gate. A system is not production-ready because one demo looks good; it must remain good across representative tasks, adversarial cases, versions, tenants and cost/latency constraints.

## Evaluation stack

```text
Dataset / production-safe traces
        ↓
Task cases + expected evidence
        ↓
Retrieval evaluation
        ↓
Generation / citation evaluation
        ↓
Agent trajectory evaluation
        ↓
Security + policy evaluation
        ↓
Cost + latency evaluation
        ↓
Regression / A-B decision
        ↓
Release gate
```

## Learning outcomes

- Build deterministic evaluation cases.
- Separate retrieval, generation, tool, agent and end-to-end metrics.
- Design golden datasets without leakage.
- Compare model/prompt/retrieval versions fairly.
- Use confidence intervals and minimum practical improvements.
- Run A/B and shadow evaluations.
- Detect regressions hidden by averages.
- Evaluate safety and authorization separately from answer quality.
- Convert production incidents into permanent regression tests.

## Evaluation dimensions

### Task success
Did the system accomplish the user's actual goal?

### Retrieval
Recall@K, MRR, nDCG, evidence precision and coverage.

### Generation
Groundedness, citation correctness, completeness and factual consistency.

### Agent behavior
Tool correctness, plan validity, verifier pass rate, unnecessary actions and trajectory efficiency.

### Security
Injection resistance, policy adherence, tenant isolation and unauthorized-action rate.

### Operations
Latency, token use, cost, retries, timeout rate and resource consumption.

## Golden-case contract

Each case should capture:

```text
case_id
input
context/tenant
expected outcome
acceptable answers or assertions
required evidence
forbidden behavior
risk level
budget
metadata/version
```

Avoid storing secrets or sensitive production content in the benchmark repository.

## Fair comparison rules

When comparing systems, hold constant what should not change:

- evaluation cases;
- task definitions;
- retrieval corpus/version where appropriate;
- tool fixtures;
- safety policy;
- budget;
- judge protocol.

Record everything that does change.

## Statistical thinking

A/B results should include:

- sample size;
- mean and median;
- tail latency;
- success rate;
- confidence interval;
- failure categories;
- cost per successful task.

Do not declare victory from a tiny noisy sample or from a single aggregate score.

## Detailed labs

### Lab 1 — Evaluation case schema
Build typed cases with assertions and forbidden behaviors.

### Lab 2 — Golden dataset
Create a small enterprise benchmark with retrieval, generation and tool cases.

### Lab 3 — Retrieval regression
Compare two indexes using Recall@K and nDCG.

### Lab 4 — Generation regression
Compare two prompts/models using groundedness and citation correctness.

### Lab 5 — Agent trajectory scoring
Score tool selection, unnecessary actions, verification and completion.

### Lab 6 — Security benchmark
Inject direct/indirect prompt attacks and measure blocked unauthorized actions.

### Lab 7 — Cost-quality frontier
Plot quality against cost per successful task.

### Lab 8 — A/B evaluation
Run two deterministic fixtures and calculate outcome deltas.

### Lab 9 — Shadow evaluation
Evaluate a candidate version without affecting production users.

### Lab 10 — Regression gate
Fail a release when critical quality or safety metrics cross thresholds.

### Lab 11 — Confidence intervals
Estimate uncertainty and avoid overclaiming small improvements.

### Lab 12 — Incident-to-test
Convert a Module 22 incident into a regression case.

### Lab 13 — Metric gaming
Construct a system that improves one metric while degrading real task success; detect it.

### Lab 14 — Slice analysis
Find failures by tenant, task type, language, risk, retrieval depth or tool path.

### Lab 15 — Release certification
Produce an evaluation report with pass/fail decision and evidence.

## Failure-first exercises

- leaked benchmark answers;
- duplicate cases;
- judge bias;
- tiny sample size;
- cherry-picked successful runs;
- average hides p95 regression;
- quality improves while security degrades;
- cost doubles for a tiny gain;
- candidate changes retrieval and model simultaneously;
- one tenant regresses while global score improves.

## Production release gate

Example policy:

```text
BLOCK if critical security test fails
BLOCK if task success drops beyond tolerance
BLOCK if groundedness drops beyond tolerance
BLOCK if p95 latency violates SLO
BLOCK if cost/success exceeds budget
WARN if small statistically uncertain regression
```

The gate must be explicit, versioned and reviewable.

## Industry scenarios

**Banking:** transaction-assistant evaluation must treat unauthorized actions as catastrophic regardless of answer-quality score.

**Healthcare:** evaluate evidence grounding and unsafe recommendations separately.

**Cybersecurity:** measure correct containment decisions, false positives and policy violations.

**Enterprise IT:** evaluate resolution success, tool correctness, rollback behavior and change-risk constraints.

## Interview bank

1. What makes a good evaluation case?
2. Why separate retrieval from generation evaluation?
3. Why can average quality be misleading?
4. How do you evaluate agent trajectories?
5. How do you prevent benchmark leakage?
6. When is an A/B result statistically meaningful?
7. How do you evaluate safety separately from usefulness?
8. What belongs in a release gate?
9. How do you compare two changing components fairly?
10. How do you turn incidents into regression tests?
11. What is shadow evaluation?
12. How would you evaluate 100,000 agent tasks?

## Coding challenges

- evaluation-case validator;
- metric aggregator;
- Recall/MRR/nDCG calculator;
- trajectory scorer;
- slice analyzer;
- confidence-interval calculator;
- A/B comparator;
- regression gate;
- benchmark leakage detector;
- evaluation report generator.

## Mastery gate

Take two AegisAI versions, run the same benchmark, analyze quality/security/cost/latency slices, quantify uncertainty and produce a defensible release decision.

## Gold challenge

Build **AegisAI Production Evaluation System** connected to Modules 11, 22 and 25. Every production incident can become a benchmark case, every candidate release is evaluated consistently, and critical safety regressions automatically block deployment.

## Expanded long-form course chapter

This course is a practical engineering progression from deterministic software and LLM applications to retrieval, tools, stateful agents, distributed coordination, knowledge graphs, durable autonomy, verification, computer use, and controlled self-improvement. The governing idea is that an AI system becomes production-grade not by adding more model calls, but by adding explicit boundaries around probabilistic decisions. Throughout the 43 modules, the learner repeatedly asks: What is the goal? What state is authoritative? What evidence is available? What actions are permitted? What budget applies? What must be verified? What happens when a dependency fails? What must be observable and auditable? What evidence would justify changing the design?

The course uses the AegisAI mental model: Model + Harness + Environment + Tools + State + Policy + Budget + Verification. Retrieval is treated as a knowledge mechanism; an agent loop is treated as a decision-and-action mechanism; a harness is treated as the control plane around the model; and a verifier is treated as an independent check on outcomes. This distinction prevents a common engineering failure in which a prompt is asked to perform authorization, correctness checking, persistence, and business policy simultaneously.

Every module follows the same learning rhythm: Predict → Run → Observe → Explain → Break → Debug → Measure → Improve → Defend. The examples therefore emphasize observable mechanisms, explicit contracts, failure injection, metrics, and regression tests. The notebooks and applications are intended to work with deterministic fakes and synthetic data wherever possible, so that the learner can understand the mechanism before depending on a commercial provider.

## Module-specific learning contract

This expanded chapter deepens the repository canonical learning objectives for **Module 26: Production Evaluation**. The objective vocabulary is preserved: production evaluation, A/B, shadow, confidence intervals, slice analysis, and release gate. Each concept is connected to architecture, implementation, failure analysis, evaluation, security, operations and system-design reasoning.

## First-principles concepts

### 1. Production Evaluation

The first principle for Production Evaluation is to make the boundary explicit. A production implementation should state what enters the component, what leaves it, what state it may mutate, what policy constrains it, and what evidence proves that the operation succeeded. When those boundaries are hidden inside a framework, failures become difficult to localize. In this module, production evaluation should therefore be treated as an engineering contract rather than a collection of API calls. A useful review asks which decisions are deterministic, which decisions are probabilistic, which data is trusted, and which observations are required to reconstruct a failed run.

### 2. A/B

A practical way to learn Production Evaluation is to start with the smallest executable mechanism and then add one production constraint at a time. Begin with a happy-path example for A/B; add typed inputs; introduce malformed input; introduce a dependency timeout; add a policy restriction; add telemetry; then replay the same scenario. This progression makes cause and effect visible. Do not add architecture merely because the technology is available. Add it when a measured requirement or failure mode justifies the complexity.

### 3. Shadow

In an enterprise setting, Production Evaluation rarely exists in isolation. Identity, tenancy, data classification, latency objectives, cost limits, audit requirements and operational ownership all change the design. A mechanism that works for a personal prototype may be unacceptable when the same request can cross a tenant boundary or trigger a financial action. The correct design combines the technical mechanism with deterministic controls outside the model. shadow becomes useful only when the surrounding system can enforce who may use it, what evidence it may access, what it may change, and how the result will be checked.

### 4. Confidence Intervals

The failure-first perspective is especially important for Production Evaluation. A system that works on the happy path proves very little. The stronger question is what happens when input is incomplete, a dependency is slow, returned data is contradictory, a user disconnects, policy changes, state is stale, or an attacker deliberately supplies hostile content. For confidence intervals, define the expected observable before injecting the fault. Record the first failing stage, containment boundary, recovery action, and regression assertion. This converts debugging from intuition into an experiment.

### 5. Slice Analysis

Measurement should accompany every meaningful change to Production Evaluation. Quality, latency and cost are often coupled. Larger context may improve answer quality but increase latency and token cost. More retries may improve availability during short outages while amplifying load during a large outage. A stronger verifier may reduce unsafe actions while increasing response time. For slice analysis, maintain a scorecard containing task success, relevant quality metrics, p50/p95 latency, resource consumption, failure rate, and policy or verification failures. The goal is to make trade-offs explicit.

### 6. Release Gate

A useful architecture diagram for Production Evaluation separates mechanism from control. The mechanism performs useful work; the control plane establishes identity, validates inputs, enforces authorization, manages budgets, records telemetry, and verifies outcomes. For release gate, draw both layers. Ask whether the system would remain safe if the model produced a wrong answer. If not, a critical control is probably living in the wrong place. Production AI engineering moves irreversible decisions away from untrusted model output and toward deterministic policy, typed interfaces and independent verification.

### 7. Production Evaluation

Versioning is part of the technical design of Production Evaluation, not an administrative afterthought. Prompts, models, embeddings, retrieval indexes, policies, tools, graph schemas, memory records and verifier rules can all change behavior. If production evaluation changes without a version identifier, a later incident may be impossible to reproduce. A practical implementation records the versions involved in each important run and defines a rollback boundary. The learner should be able to answer not only what the system did, but which artifact versions caused it to behave that way.

### 8. A/B

The final production question for Production Evaluation is whether the mechanism improves the business outcome enough to justify its operational cost. A technically elegant system can still be a poor product if it is too slow, too expensive, too difficult to monitor, or too risky. For A/B, compare the mechanism with a simpler baseline. State the baseline, measurable improvement, new failure modes, and operational burden. Use the simplest architecture that meets the requirement, and add complexity only when evidence shows that the additional capability creates value.

## Architecture and control boundaries

In an enterprise setting, Production Evaluation rarely exists in isolation. Identity, tenancy, data classification, latency objectives, cost limits, audit requirements and operational ownership all change the design. A mechanism that works for a personal prototype may be unacceptable when the same request can cross a tenant boundary or trigger a financial action. The correct design combines the technical mechanism with deterministic controls outside the model. shadow becomes useful only when the surrounding system can enforce who may use it, what evidence it may access, what it may change, and how the result will be checked.

### 4. Confidence Intervals

The failure-first perspective is especially important for Production Evaluation. A system that works on the happy path proves very little. The stronger question is what happens when input is incomplete, a dependency is slow, returned data is contradictory, a user disconnects, policy changes, state is stale, or an attacker deliberately supplies hostile content. For confidence intervals, define the expected observable before injecting the fault. Record the first failing stage, containment boundary, recovery action, and regression assertion. This converts debugging from intuition into an experiment.

### 5. Slice Analysis

Measurement should accompany every meaningful change to Production Evaluation. Quality, latency and cost are often coupled. Larger context may improve answer quality but increase latency and token cost. More retries may improve availability during short outages while amplifying load during a large outage. A stronger verifier may reduce unsafe actions while increasing response time. For slice analysis, maintain a scorecard containing task success, relevant quality metrics, p50/p95 latency, resource consumption, failure rate, and policy or verification failures. The goal is to make trade-offs explicit.

### 6. Release Gate

A useful architecture diagram for Production Evaluation separates mechanism from control. The mechanism performs useful work; the control plane establishes identity, validates inputs, enforces authorization, manages budgets, records telemetry, and verifies outcomes. For release gate, draw both layers. Ask whether the system would remain safe if the model produced a wrong answer. If not, a critical control is probably living in the wrong place. Production AI engineering moves irreversible decisions away from untrusted model output and toward deterministic policy, typed interfaces and independent verification.

### 7. Production Evaluation

Versioning is part of the technical design of Production Evaluation, not an administrative afterthought. Prompts, models, embeddings, retrieval indexes, policies, tools, graph schemas, memory records and verifier rules can all change behavior. If production evaluation changes without a version identifier, a later incident may be impossible to reproduce. A practical implementation records the versions involved in each important run and defines a rollback boundary. The learner should be able to answer not only what the system did, but which artifact versions caused it to behave that way.

### 8. A/B

The final production question for Production Evaluation is whether the mechanism improves the business outcome enough to justify its operational cost. A technically elegant system can still be a poor product if it is too slow, too expensive, too difficult to monitor, or too risky. For A/B, compare the mechanism with a simpler baseline. State the baseline, measurable improvement, new failure modes, and operational burden. Use the simplest architecture that meets the requirement, and add complexity only when evidence shows that the additional capability creates value.

## Production design and operational readiness

### 1. Production Evaluation

The first principle for Production Evaluation is to make the boundary explicit. A production implementation should state what enters the component, what leaves it, what state it may mutate, what policy constrains it, and what evidence proves that the operation succeeded. When those boundaries are hidden inside a framework, failures become difficult to localize. In this module, production evaluation should therefore be treated as an engineering contract rather than a collection of API calls. A useful review asks which decisions are deterministic, which decisions are probabilistic, which data is trusted, and which observations are required to reconstruct a failed run.

### 2. A/B

A practical way to learn Production Evaluation is to start with the smallest executable mechanism and then add one production constraint at a time. Begin with a happy-path example for A/B; add typed inputs; introduce malformed input; introduce a dependency timeout; add a policy restriction; add telemetry; then replay the same scenario. This progression makes cause and effect visible. Do not add architecture merely because the technology is available. Add it when a measured requirement or failure mode justifies the complexity.

## Mastery gate

Completion means being able to explain the mechanism from first principles, implement the smallest working version, deliberately break it, identify the first failing boundary from evidence, repair it, measure the repaired system against a baseline, and defend the resulting trade-offs. The learner should also explain when not to use the mechanism. Production expertise includes recognizing when a simpler deterministic solution is safer, cheaper and easier to operate.

## Deep case study 1: Production Evaluation

Consider an enterprise workload in which production evaluation is a material part of the decision path. Start by stating the business outcome, users, data boundary, expected action, and failure cost. Establish a baseline before introducing the module mechanism. Then define the smallest implementation that demonstrates it. Instrument the boundary so a reviewer can see inputs, intermediate state, decisions, outputs, latency and resource usage without exposing secrets or unnecessary personal data. Introduce one controlled failure at a time: malformed input, missing evidence, stale state, dependency timeout, authorization mismatch, contradictory data, unexpected model output, or policy change. For each failure, identify the first observable deviation from the expected contract. Do not jump directly to a fix; write a hypothesis and run an experiment that distinguishes it from competing explanations. After the fix, replay the same failure and verify that the regression test protects the boundary. Finally, compare the improved implementation with the baseline on task success, latency, cost and operational complexity. A strong design review should explain why the architecture is sufficient, which alternatives were rejected, what evidence supports the decision, and what future observation would justify revisiting it.

This case also illustrates why production evaluation cannot be delegated blindly to a language model. If the model produces an incorrect recommendation, the surrounding application must still enforce authorization, budget, data access, and verification. Where an action is irreversible or high impact, introduce an approval boundary or deterministic verifier. Where information is uncertain, represent uncertainty rather than manufacturing confidence. Where knowledge can become stale, record versions and effective dates. Where the workload is multi-tenant, apply tenant isolation before candidate truncation or action selection. Where the system is long-running, persist state and make side effects idempotent. These controls are the engineering environment in which the module mechanism becomes trustworthy.

## Deep case study 2: A/B

## Deep case study 6: Release Gate

Consider an enterprise workload in which release gate is a material part of the decision path. Start by stating the business outcome, users, data boundary, expected action, and failure cost. Establish a baseline before introducing the module mechanism. Then define the smallest implementation that demonstrates it. Instrument the boundary so a reviewer can see inputs, intermediate state, decisions, outputs, latency and resource usage without exposing secrets or unnecessary personal data. Introduce one controlled failure at a time: malformed input, missing evidence, stale state, dependency timeout, authorization mismatch, contradictory data, unexpected model output, or policy change. For each failure, identify the first observable deviation from the expected contract. Do not jump directly to a fix; write a hypothesis and run an experiment that distinguishes it from competing explanations.

Finally, compare the improved implementation with the baseline on task success, latency, cost and operational complexity.

Instrument the boundary so a reviewer can see inputs, intermediate state, decisions, outputs, latency and resource usage without exposing secrets or unnecessary personal data. Introduce one controlled failure at a time: malformed input, missing evidence, stale state, dependency timeout, authorization mismatch, contradictory data, unexpected model output, or policy change. For each failure, identify the first observable deviation from the expected contract. Do not jump directly to a fix; write a hypothesis and run an experiment that distinguishes it from competing explanations. After the fix, replay the same failure and verify that the regression test protects the boundary. Finally, compare the improved implementation with the baseline on task success, latency, cost and operational complexity. A strong design review should explain why the architecture is sufficient, which alternatives were rejected, what evidence supports the decision, and what future observation would justify revisiting it.

This case also illustrates why A/B cannot be delegated blindly to a language model. If the model produces an incorrect recommendation, the surrounding application must still enforce authorization, budget, data access, and verification. Where an action is irreversible or high impact, introduce an approval boundary or deterministic verifier. Where information is uncertain, represent uncertainty rather than manufacturing confidence. Where knowledge can become stale, record versions and effective dates. Where the workload is multi-tenant, apply tenant isolation before candidate truncation or action selection. Where the system is long-running, persist state and make side effects idempotent. These controls are the engineering environment in which the module mechanism becomes trustworthy.
