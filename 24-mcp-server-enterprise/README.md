# Module 24 — MCP Server — Enterprise




## Mission

Turn the Module 23 client boundary into a governed enterprise capability server. The server owns capability contracts and safe execution mechanics; the surrounding AegisAI control plane owns identity, authorization, approval, audit, budgets and verification.

## Learning outcomes

- Design an MCP server capability catalog.
- Build typed, deterministic tool handlers.
- Separate discovery from authorization.
- Enforce tenant boundaries at execution time.
- Handle lifecycle, versioning, timeouts and errors.
- Make side effects idempotent.
- Expose resources without leaking unrestricted data.
- Test malicious tool inputs and outputs.
- Instrument every request for Module 22 debugging.

## Server design principles

1. **Explicit contracts:** every tool has a stable schema.
2. **Least privilege:** expose the smallest useful capability.
3. **Fail closed:** invalid identity, arguments or tenant context means no execution.
4. **Side-effect discipline:** mutation requires idempotency and authorization.
5. **Untrusted outputs:** returned content cannot change policy.
6. **Version everything:** server, capability, schema and downstream dependency.
7. **Observe everything important:** request, decision, execution, result and error.

## Capability types

### Tools
Actions that execute code or cause side effects.

### Resources
Read-oriented contextual data. Resource URIs must still be authorized.

### Prompts
Reusable templates. Never treat a server prompt as a privileged system instruction.

## Detailed labs

### Lab 1 — Server manifest
Create a catalog with tools/resources/prompts and versions.

### Lab 2 — Tool contract
Implement typed validation and canonical argument serialization.

### Lab 3 — Read-only resource
Expose tenant-scoped documents through an authorized resource handler.

### Lab 4 — Mutation tool
Build an idempotent update operation with exact action identity.

### Lab 5 — Authentication boundary
Simulate authenticated principals and reject missing/invalid identity.

### Lab 6 — Authorization
Map principal roles and tenants to capability permissions.

### Lab 7 — Approval gate
Require a matching approval for high-risk mutation.

### Lab 8 — Rate/timeout budget
Prevent slow or abusive clients from consuming unlimited resources.

### Lab 9 — Audit and tracing
Emit correlation, causation, policy and execution events.

### Lab 10 — Schema evolution
Introduce v2 of a tool without silently breaking v1 clients.

### Lab 11 — Failure injection
Test downstream timeout, malformed dependency response, duplicate request and partial failure.

### Lab 12 — Security red team
Attempt cross-tenant access, argument injection, SSRF-like URL access and policy override through tool output.

### Lab 13 — Operational readiness
Implement health/readiness semantics, graceful shutdown and bounded concurrency.

### Lab 14 — Debugging integration
Feed server events into Module 22's distributed debugger and identify first failure.

### Lab 15 — Production review
Write a threat model, SLO, rollback plan and emergency capability-revocation procedure.

## Failure-first exercises

Break the server intentionally:

- remove a required argument;
- alter the schema version;
- replay a mutation;
- use another tenant ID;
- expire approval before execution;
- return malicious content;
- make the dependency hang;
- make the downstream API return a conflicting version;
- exceed rate limits;
- leak a secret through an error message.

For every failure, document **expected behavior, observed behavior, root cause and regression test**.

## Production metrics

- request success/error rate;
- p50/p95/p99 latency;
- active sessions;
- capability invocation volume;
- authorization-denial rate;
- approval rejection/expiry rate;
- duplicate mutation rate;
- downstream failure rate;
- tenant isolation violations;
- cost/resource consumption;
- trace completeness.

## Industry scenarios

**Banking:** account lookup and payment initiation separated into distinct capabilities with different approval requirements.

**Healthcare:** patient resources scoped by organization and purpose; mutation tools isolated behind stronger controls.

**Cybersecurity:** threat-intelligence reads separated from containment actions.

**Enterprise IT:** ticket reads available broadly while infrastructure mutation requires elevated role, approval and audit.

## Interview questions

1. What belongs inside an MCP server?
2. Where should authorization happen?
3. Why is capability discovery not authorization?
4. How do you make a mutation idempotent?
5. How should resource URIs be secured?
6. How do you evolve a tool schema safely?
7. What should happen on downstream timeout?
8. How do you prevent tool output from becoming privileged instructions?
9. How do you revoke a dangerous capability quickly?
10. How would you scale a server serving thousands of agents?
11. What belongs in the audit trail?
12. How would you debug a server-induced agent failure?

## System-design challenge

Design a regional MCP capability platform serving 50,000 agents and 5,000 enterprise tools. Include authentication, authorization, tenant isolation, capability registry, rate limits, idempotency, approvals, observability, versioning, failover and emergency revocation.

## Coding challenges

- capability registry;
- schema validator;
- principal/tenant authorizer;
- canonical action hash;
- idempotency store;
- approval checker;
- resource URI authorizer;
- retry classifier;
- audit correlator;
- schema compatibility checker.

## Mastery gate

Build a server with at least two read capabilities and one mutation capability. Demonstrate tenant isolation, typed validation, idempotency, approval, audit, timeout handling and a regression suite.

## Gold challenge

Connect Modules 18–23 to build **AegisAI Enterprise MCP Gateway** where every external capability crosses a visible security and observability boundary before execution.

## Expanded long-form course chapter

This course is a practical engineering progression from deterministic software and LLM applications to retrieval, tools, stateful agents, distributed coordination, knowledge graphs, durable autonomy, verification, computer use, and controlled self-improvement. The governing idea is that an AI system becomes production-grade not by adding more model calls, but by adding explicit boundaries around probabilistic decisions. Throughout the 43 modules, the learner repeatedly asks: What is the goal? What state is authoritative? What evidence is available? What actions are permitted? What budget applies? What must be verified? What happens when a dependency fails? What must be observable and auditable? What evidence would justify changing the design?

The course uses the AegisAI mental model: Model + Harness + Environment + Tools + State + Policy + Budget + Verification. Retrieval is treated as a knowledge mechanism; an agent loop is treated as a decision-and-action mechanism; a harness is treated as the control plane around the model; and a verifier is treated as an independent check on outcomes. This distinction prevents a common engineering failure in which a prompt is asked to perform authorization, correctness checking, persistence, and business policy simultaneously.

Every module follows the same learning rhythm: Predict → Run → Observe → Explain → Break → Debug → Measure → Improve → Defend. The examples therefore emphasize observable mechanisms, explicit contracts, failure injection, metrics, and regression tests. The notebooks and applications are intended to work with deterministic fakes and synthetic data wherever possible, so that the learner can understand the mechanism before depending on a commercial provider.

## Module-specific learning contract

This expanded chapter deepens the repository canonical learning objectives for **Module 24: MCP Server — Enterprise**. The objective vocabulary is preserved: MCP server, capability catalog, typed handlers, tenant boundary, idempotency, and audit. Each concept is connected to architecture, implementation, failure analysis, evaluation, security, operations and system-design reasoning.

## First-principles concepts

### 1. Mcp Server

The first principle for MCP Server — Enterprise is to make the boundary explicit. A production implementation should state what enters the component, what leaves it, what state it may mutate, what policy constrains it, and what evidence proves that the operation succeeded. When those boundaries are hidden inside a framework, failures become difficult to localize. In this module, MCP server should therefore be treated as an engineering contract rather than a collection of API calls. A useful review asks which decisions are deterministic, which decisions are probabilistic, which data is trusted, and which observations are required to reconstruct a failed run.

### 2. Capability Catalog

A practical way to learn MCP Server — Enterprise is to start with the smallest executable mechanism and then add one production constraint at a time. Begin with a happy-path example for capability catalog; add typed inputs; introduce malformed input; introduce a dependency timeout; add a policy restriction; add telemetry; then replay the same scenario. This progression makes cause and effect visible. Do not add architecture merely because the technology is available. Add it when a measured requirement or failure mode justifies the complexity.

### 3. Typed Handlers

In an enterprise setting, MCP Server — Enterprise rarely exists in isolation. Identity, tenancy, data classification, latency objectives, cost limits, audit requirements and operational ownership all change the design. A mechanism that works for a personal prototype may be unacceptable when the same request can cross a tenant boundary or trigger a financial action. The correct design combines the technical mechanism with deterministic controls outside the model. typed handlers becomes useful only when the surrounding system can enforce who may use it, what evidence it may access, what it may change, and how the result will be checked.

### 4. Tenant Boundary

The failure-first perspective is especially important for MCP Server — Enterprise. A system that works on the happy path proves very little. The stronger question is what happens when input is incomplete, a dependency is slow, returned data is contradictory, a user disconnects, policy changes, state is stale, or an attacker deliberately supplies hostile content. For tenant boundary, define the expected observable before injecting the fault. Record the first failing stage, containment boundary, recovery action, and regression assertion. This converts debugging from intuition into an experiment.

### 5. Idempotency

Measurement should accompany every meaningful change to MCP Server — Enterprise. Quality, latency and cost are often coupled. Larger context may improve answer quality but increase latency and token cost. More retries may improve availability during short outages while amplifying load during a large outage. A stronger verifier may reduce unsafe actions while increasing response time. For idempotency, maintain a scorecard containing task success, relevant quality metrics, p50/p95 latency, resource consumption, failure rate, and policy or verification failures. The goal is to make trade-offs explicit.

### 6. Audit

A useful architecture diagram for MCP Server — Enterprise separates mechanism from control. The mechanism performs useful work; the control plane establishes identity, validates inputs, enforces authorization, manages budgets, records telemetry, and verifies outcomes. For audit, draw both layers. Ask whether the system would remain safe if the model produced a wrong answer. If not, a critical control is probably living in the wrong place. Production AI engineering moves irreversible decisions away from untrusted model output and toward deterministic policy, typed interfaces and independent verification.

### 7. Mcp Server

Versioning is part of the technical design of MCP Server — Enterprise, not an administrative afterthought. Prompts, models, embeddings, retrieval indexes, policies, tools, graph schemas, memory records and verifier rules can all change behavior. If MCP server changes without a version identifier, a later incident may be impossible to reproduce. A practical implementation records the versions involved in each important run and defines a rollback boundary. The learner should be able to answer not only what the system did, but which artifact versions caused it to behave that way.

### 8. Capability Catalog

The final production question for MCP Server — Enterprise is whether the mechanism improves the business outcome enough to justify its operational cost. A technically elegant system can still be a poor product if it is too slow, too expensive, too difficult to monitor, or too risky. For capability catalog, compare the mechanism with a simpler baseline. State the baseline, measurable improvement, new failure modes, and operational burden. Use the simplest architecture that meets the requirement, and add complexity only when evidence shows that the additional capability creates value.

Begin with a happy-path example for capability catalog; add typed inputs; introduce malformed input; introduce a dependency timeout; add a policy restriction; add telemetry; then replay the same scenario. This progression makes cause and effect visible. Do not add architecture merely because the technology is available. Add it when a measured requirement or failure mode justifies the complexity.

### 3. Typed Handlers

In an enterprise setting, MCP Server — Enterprise rarely exists in isolation. Identity, tenancy, data classification, latency objectives, cost limits, audit requirements and operational ownership all change the design. A mechanism that works for a personal prototype may be unacceptable when the same request can cross a tenant boundary or trigger a financial action. The correct design combines the technical mechanism with deterministic controls outside the model. typed handlers becomes useful only when the surrounding system can enforce who may use it, what evidence it may access, what it may change, and how the result will be checked.

### 4. Tenant Boundary

The failure-first perspective is especially important for MCP Server — Enterprise. A system that works on the happy path proves very little. The stronger question is what happens when input is incomplete, a dependency is slow, returned data is contradictory, a user disconnects, policy changes, state is stale, or an attacker deliberately supplies hostile content. For tenant boundary, define the expected observable before injecting the fault. Record the first failing stage, containment boundary, recovery action, and regression assertion. This converts debugging from intuition into an experiment.

### 5. Idempotency

Measurement should accompany every meaningful change to MCP Server — Enterprise. Quality, latency and cost are often coupled. Larger context may improve answer quality but increase latency and token cost. More retries may improve availability during short outages while amplifying load during a large outage. A stronger verifier may reduce unsafe actions while increasing response time. For idempotency, maintain a scorecard containing task success, relevant quality metrics, p50/p95 latency, resource consumption, failure rate, and policy or verification failures. The goal is to make trade-offs explicit.

### 6. Audit

A useful architecture diagram for MCP Server — Enterprise separates mechanism from control. The mechanism performs useful work; the control plane establishes identity, validates inputs, enforces authorization, manages budgets, records telemetry, and verifies outcomes. For audit, draw both layers. Ask whether the system would remain safe if the model produced a wrong answer. If not, a critical control is probably living in the wrong place. Production AI engineering moves irreversible decisions away from untrusted model output and toward deterministic policy, typed interfaces and independent verification.

### 7. Mcp Server

Versioning is part of the technical design of MCP Server — Enterprise, not an administrative afterthought. Prompts, models, embeddings, retrieval indexes, policies, tools, graph schemas, memory records and verifier rules can all change behavior. If MCP server changes without a version identifier, a later incident may be impossible to reproduce. A practical implementation records the versions involved in each important run and defines a rollback boundary. The learner should be able to answer not only what the system did, but which artifact versions caused it to behave that way.

### 8. Capability Catalog

The final production question for MCP Server — Enterprise is whether the mechanism improves the business outcome enough to justify its operational cost. A technically elegant system can still be a poor product if it is too slow, too expensive, too difficult to monitor, or too risky. For capability catalog, compare the mechanism with a simpler baseline. State the baseline, measurable improvement, new failure modes, and operational burden. Use the simplest architecture that meets the requirement, and add complexity only when evidence shows that the additional capability creates value.

## Production design and operational readiness

### 1. Mcp Server

The first principle for MCP Server — Enterprise is to make the boundary explicit. A production implementation should state what enters the component, what leaves it, what state it may mutate, what policy constrains it, and what evidence proves that the operation succeeded. When those boundaries are hidden inside a framework, failures become difficult to localize. In this module, MCP server should therefore be treated as an engineering contract rather than a collection of API calls. A useful review asks which decisions are deterministic, which decisions are probabilistic, which data is trusted, and which observations are required to reconstruct a failed run.

## Mastery gate

Completion means being able to explain the mechanism from first principles, implement the smallest working version, deliberately break it, identify the first failing boundary from evidence, repair it, measure the repaired system against a baseline, and defend the resulting trade-offs. The learner should also explain when not to use the mechanism. Production expertise includes recognizing when a simpler deterministic solution is safer, cheaper and easier to operate.

## Deep case study 1: Mcp Server

Consider an enterprise workload in which MCP server is a material part of the decision path. Start by stating the business outcome, users, data boundary, expected action, and failure cost. Establish a baseline before introducing the module mechanism. Then define the smallest implementation that demonstrates it. Instrument the boundary so a reviewer can see inputs, intermediate state, decisions, outputs, latency and resource usage without exposing secrets or unnecessary personal data. Introduce one controlled failure at a time: malformed input, missing evidence, stale state, dependency timeout, authorization mismatch, contradictory data, unexpected model output, or policy change. For each failure, identify the first observable deviation from the expected contract. Do not jump directly to a fix; write a hypothesis and run an experiment that distinguishes it from competing explanations. After the fix, replay the same failure and verify that the regression test protects the boundary. Finally, compare the improved implementation with the baseline on task success, latency, cost and operational complexity. A strong design review should explain why the architecture is sufficient, which alternatives were rejected, what evidence supports the decision, and what future observation would justify revisiting it.

This case also illustrates why MCP server cannot be delegated blindly to a language model. If the model produces an incorrect recommendation, the surrounding application must still enforce authorization, budget, data access, and verification. Where an action is irreversible or high impact, introduce an approval boundary or deterministic verifier. Where information is uncertain, represent uncertainty rather than manufacturing confidence. Where knowledge can become stale, record versions and effective dates. Where the workload is multi-tenant, apply tenant isolation before candidate truncation or action selection. Where the system is long-running, persist state and make side effects idempotent. These controls are the engineering environment in which the module mechanism becomes trustworthy.

## Deep case study 2: Capability Catalog

Consider an enterprise workload in which capability catalog is a material part of the decision path. Start by stating the business outcome, users, data boundary, expected action, and failure cost.

## Deep case study 5: Idempotency

Consider an enterprise workload in which idempotency is a material part of the decision path. Start by stating the business outcome, users, data boundary, expected action, and failure cost. Establish a baseline before introducing the module mechanism. Then define the smallest implementation that demonstrates it. Instrument the boundary so a reviewer can see inputs, intermediate state, decisions, outputs, latency and resource usage without exposing secrets or unnecessary personal data. Introduce one controlled failure at a time: malformed input, missing evidence, stale state, dependency timeout, authorization mismatch, contradictory data, unexpected model output, or policy change. For each failure, identify the first observable deviation from the expected contract. Do not jump directly to a fix; write a hypothesis and run an experiment that distinguishes it from competing explanations. After the fix, replay the same failure and verify that the regression test protects the boundary. Finally, compare the improved implementation with the baseline on task success, latency, cost and operational complexity. A strong design review should explain why the architecture is sufficient, which alternatives were rejected, what evidence supports the decision, and what future observation would justify revisiting it.

This case also illustrates why idempotency cannot be delegated blindly to a language model. If the model produces an incorrect recommendation, the surrounding application must still enforce authorization, budget, data access, and verification.

After the fix, replay the same failure and verify that the regression test protects the boundary. Finally, compare the improved implementation with the baseline on task success, latency, cost and operational complexity. A strong design review should explain why the architecture is sufficient, which alternatives were rejected, what evidence supports the decision, and what future observation would justify revisiting it.

This case also illustrates why MCP server cannot be delegated blindly to a language model. If the model produces an incorrect recommendation, the surrounding application must still enforce authorization, budget, data access, and verification. Where an action is irreversible or high impact, introduce an approval boundary or deterministic verifier. Where information is uncertain, represent uncertainty rather than manufacturing confidence. Where knowledge can become stale, record versions and effective dates. Where the workload is multi-tenant, apply tenant isolation before candidate truncation or action selection. Where the system is long-running, persist state and make side effects idempotent. These controls are the engineering environment in which the module mechanism becomes trustworthy.

## Deep case study 26: Capability Catalog

Consider an enterprise workload in which capability catalog is a material part of the decision path. Start by stating the business outcome, users, data boundary, expected action, and failure cost. Establish a baseline before introducing the module mechanism. Then define the smallest implementation that demonstrates it. Instrument the boundary so a reviewer can see inputs, intermediate state, decisions, outputs, latency and resource usage without exposing secrets or unnecessary personal data. Introduce one controlled failure at a time: malformed input, missing evidence, stale state, dependency timeout, authorization mismatch, contradictory data, unexpected model output, or policy change. For each failure, identify the first observable deviation from the expected contract. Do not jump directly to a fix; write a hypothesis and run an experiment that distinguishes it from competing explanations.
