# Module 25 — Observability




## Mission

Build the telemetry control plane for AegisAI. Observe an AI system end-to-end rather than treating the LLM as a black box.

## Learning outcomes

- Design AI-specific traces, spans and metrics.
- Correlate agent, RAG, tool, MCP and distributed-agent events.
- Attribute latency and cost to individual components.
- Track quality signals alongside infrastructure signals.
- Detect retry storms, loops and anomalous tool use.
- Build actionable alerts rather than noisy dashboards.
- Preserve security, privacy and tenant boundaries.
- Feed telemetry into Module 22 debugging and Module 26 evaluation.

## Why ordinary observability is insufficient

Traditional telemetry answers **"is the service healthy?"**

Agentic observability must also answer:

- Did the agent accomplish the task?
- Which evidence influenced the answer?
- Which tool was selected and why?
- Was the action authorized?
- Did the verifier accept it?
- How much did the run cost?
- Where did latency accumulate?
- Did the agent loop unnecessarily?
- Did an untrusted input cross a security boundary?

## Canonical trace

```text
run
 ├─ agent.observe
 ├─ agent.decide
 ├─ retrieval
 │   ├─ query
 │   └─ ranking
 ├─ model
 ├─ tool
 │   └─ MCP server
 ├─ state
 ├─ verification
 └─ completion
```

Every span should carry correlation identifiers and safe metadata.

## Core telemetry model

### Traces
End-to-end causal execution.

### Spans
Component-level operations with start/end time and status.

### Metrics
Aggregated signals such as p95 latency, token usage and error rate.

### Events
Discrete security, policy, approval, retry and lifecycle events.

### Logs
Human-readable diagnostic context, with strict redaction.

## AI-specific metrics

### Reliability
- task success rate;
- completion/error rate;
- retry rate;
- timeout rate;
- duplicate action rate.

### Quality

- critical-path duration.

### Economics
- input/output tokens;
- cost/run;
- cost/agent;
- cost/tool;
- cost/successful task;
- retry amplification.

### Security

## Failure-first exercises

Break observability deliberately:

- missing parent span;
- incorrect timestamps;
- duplicate events;
- dropped security event;
- cross-tenant trace query;
- unredacted secret;
- misleading success metric;
- missing tool cost;
- trace sampling hides the failure;
- clock skew;
- retry storm floods telemetry;
- model version missing from trace.

## Production architecture challenge

Design a multi-region telemetry platform with:

- ingestion gateway;
- event validation;
- durable queue;
- hot trace store;
- long-term metrics store;
- tenant isolation;
- retention policy;
- sampling;
- alert engine;
- dashboard/API layer;
- security/audit stream.

Separate the **control plane** from the **data plane** and define what happens when telemetry itself is unavailable.

## Security/privacy

Observability must not become a data-exfiltration channel.

Apply:

- field-level redaction;
- secret/token removal;
- PII minimization;
- tenant-scoped queries;
- role-based access;
- retention limits;
- immutable security events;
- safe replay fixtures.

## Interview bank

1. Why does an agent need different observability from a normal API?
2. Trace vs span vs event vs metric?
3. What belongs in an LLM span?
4. How do you attribute cost across parallel agents?
5. How do you detect loops?
6. What is tail-based sampling?
7. How do you preserve security events under sampling?
8. How would you observe 100,000 concurrent agents?
9. What if telemetry storage goes down?
10. How do you prevent telemetry from leaking PII?
11. How do quality and infrastructure metrics interact?
12. How do you design alerts that engineers will not ignore?

## Coding challenges

- trace validator;
- span duration calculator;
- critical-path engine;
- cost attribution engine;
- retry-amplification detector;
- loop detector;
- anomaly detector;
- tenant-safe query filter;
- redaction pipeline;
- SLO evaluator.

## Mastery gate

Given a failed AegisAI run, reconstruct the execution, identify the critical path, attribute cost, identify quality degradation, detect security signals and produce an actionable alert plus incident report.

## Gold challenge

Build **AegisAI Observability Platform** that receives structured telemetry from Modules 18–24, supports causal debugging, cost/latency/quality analysis and security investigation, and provides the evaluation-ready dataset required by Module 26.

## Expanded long-form course chapter

This course is a practical engineering progression from deterministic software and LLM applications to retrieval, tools, stateful agents, distributed coordination, knowledge graphs, durable autonomy, verification, computer use, and controlled self-improvement. The governing idea is that an AI system becomes production-grade not by adding more model calls, but by adding explicit boundaries around probabilistic decisions. Throughout the 43 modules, the learner repeatedly asks: What is the goal? What state is authoritative? What evidence is available? What actions are permitted? What budget applies? What must be verified? What happens when a dependency fails? What must be observable and auditable? What evidence would justify changing the design?

The course uses the AegisAI mental model: Model + Harness + Environment + Tools + State + Policy + Budget + Verification. Retrieval is treated as a knowledge mechanism; an agent loop is treated as a decision-and-action mechanism; a harness is treated as the control plane around the model; and a verifier is treated as an independent check on outcomes. This distinction prevents a common engineering failure in which a prompt is asked to perform authorization, correctness checking, persistence, and business policy simultaneously.

Every module follows the same learning rhythm: Predict → Run → Observe → Explain → Break → Debug → Measure → Improve → Defend. The examples therefore emphasize observable mechanisms, explicit contracts, failure injection, metrics, and regression tests. The notebooks and applications are intended to work with deterministic fakes and synthetic data wherever possible, so that the learner can understand the mechanism before depending on a commercial provider.

## Module-specific learning contract

This expanded chapter deepens the repository canonical learning objectives for **Module 25: Observability**. The objective vocabulary is preserved: observability, traces, spans, metrics, cost attribution, and alerts. Each concept is connected to architecture, implementation, failure analysis, evaluation, security, operations and system-design reasoning.

## First-principles concepts

### 1. Observability

The first principle for Observability is to make the boundary explicit. A production implementation should state what enters the component, what leaves it, what state it may mutate, what policy constrains it, and what evidence proves that the operation succeeded. When those boundaries are hidden inside a framework, failures become difficult to localize. In this module, observability should therefore be treated as an engineering contract rather than a collection of API calls. A useful review asks which decisions are deterministic, which decisions are probabilistic, which data is trusted, and which observations are required to reconstruct a failed run.

### 2. Traces

A practical way to learn Observability is to start with the smallest executable mechanism and then add one production constraint at a time. Begin with a happy-path example for traces; add typed inputs; introduce malformed input; introduce a dependency timeout; add a policy restriction; add telemetry; then replay the same scenario. This progression makes cause and effect visible. Do not add architecture merely because the technology is available. Add it when a measured requirement or failure mode justifies the complexity.

### 3. Spans

In an enterprise setting, Observability rarely exists in isolation. Identity, tenancy, data classification, latency objectives, cost limits, audit requirements and operational ownership all change the design. A mechanism that works for a personal prototype may be unacceptable when the same request can cross a tenant boundary or trigger a financial action. The correct design combines the technical mechanism with deterministic controls outside the model. spans becomes useful only when the surrounding system can enforce who may use it, what evidence it may access, what it may change, and how the result will be checked.

### 4. Metrics

The failure-first perspective is especially important for Observability. A system that works on the happy path proves very little. The stronger question is what happens when input is incomplete, a dependency is slow, returned data is contradictory, a user disconnects, policy changes, state is stale, or an attacker deliberately supplies hostile content. For metrics, define the expected observable before injecting the fault. Record the first failing stage, containment boundary, recovery action, and regression assertion. This converts debugging from intuition into an experiment.

### 5. Cost Attribution

Measurement should accompany every meaningful change to Observability. Quality, latency and cost are often coupled. Larger context may improve answer quality but increase latency and token cost. More retries may improve availability during short outages while amplifying load during a large outage. A stronger verifier may reduce unsafe actions while increasing response time. For cost attribution, maintain a scorecard containing task success, relevant quality metrics, p50/p95 latency, resource consumption, failure rate, and policy or verification failures. The goal is to make trade-offs explicit.

### 6. Alerts

A useful architecture diagram for Observability separates mechanism from control. The mechanism performs useful work; the control plane establishes identity, validates inputs, enforces authorization, manages budgets, records telemetry, and verifies outcomes. For alerts, draw both layers. Ask whether the system would remain safe if the model produced a wrong answer. If not, a critical control is probably living in the wrong place. Production AI engineering moves irreversible decisions away from untrusted model output and toward deterministic policy, typed interfaces and independent verification.

### 7. Observability

Versioning is part of the technical design of Observability, not an administrative afterthought. Prompts, models, embeddings, retrieval indexes, policies, tools, graph schemas, memory records and verifier rules can all change behavior. If observability changes without a version identifier, a later incident may be impossible to reproduce. A practical implementation records the versions involved in each important run and defines a rollback boundary. The learner should be able to answer not only what the system did, but which artifact versions caused it to behave that way.

### 8. Traces

The final production question for Observability is whether the mechanism improves the business outcome enough to justify its operational cost. A technically elegant system can still be a poor product if it is too slow, too expensive, too difficult to monitor, or too risky. For traces, compare the mechanism with a simpler baseline. State the baseline, measurable improvement, new failure modes, and operational burden. Use the simplest architecture that meets the requirement, and add complexity only when evidence shows that the additional capability creates value.

A useful review asks which decisions are deterministic, which decisions are probabilistic, which data is trusted, and which observations are required to reconstruct a failed run.

### 2. Traces

A practical way to learn Observability is to start with the smallest executable mechanism and then add one production constraint at a time. Begin with a happy-path example for traces; add typed inputs; introduce malformed input; introduce a dependency timeout; add a policy restriction; add telemetry; then replay the same scenario. This progression makes cause and effect visible. Do not add architecture merely because the technology is available. Add it when a measured requirement or failure mode justifies the complexity.

### 3. Spans

In an enterprise setting, Observability rarely exists in isolation. Identity, tenancy, data classification, latency objectives, cost limits, audit requirements and operational ownership all change the design. A mechanism that works for a personal prototype may be unacceptable when the same request can cross a tenant boundary or trigger a financial action. The correct design combines the technical mechanism with deterministic controls outside the model. spans becomes useful only when the surrounding system can enforce who may use it, what evidence it may access, what it may change, and how the result will be checked.

### 4. Metrics

The failure-first perspective is especially important for Observability. A system that works on the happy path proves very little. The stronger question is what happens when input is incomplete, a dependency is slow, returned data is contradictory, a user disconnects, policy changes, state is stale, or an attacker deliberately supplies hostile content. For metrics, define the expected observable before injecting the fault. Record the first failing stage, containment boundary, recovery action, and regression assertion. This converts debugging from intuition into an experiment.

### 5. Cost Attribution

Measurement should accompany every meaningful change to Observability. Quality, latency and cost are often coupled. Larger context may improve answer quality but increase latency and token cost. More retries may improve availability during short outages while amplifying load during a large outage. A stronger verifier may reduce unsafe actions while increasing response time. For cost attribution, maintain a scorecard containing task success, relevant quality metrics, p50/p95 latency, resource consumption, failure rate, and policy or verification failures. The goal is to make trade-offs explicit.

### 6. Alerts

A useful architecture diagram for Observability separates mechanism from control. The mechanism performs useful work; the control plane establishes identity, validates inputs, enforces authorization, manages budgets, records telemetry, and verifies outcomes. For alerts, draw both layers. Ask whether the system would remain safe if the model produced a wrong answer. If not, a critical control is probably living in the wrong place. Production AI engineering moves irreversible decisions away from untrusted model output and toward deterministic policy, typed interfaces and independent verification.

### 7. Observability

Versioning is part of the technical design of Observability, not an administrative afterthought. Prompts, models, embeddings, retrieval indexes, policies, tools, graph schemas, memory records and verifier rules can all change behavior. If observability changes without a version identifier, a later incident may be impossible to reproduce. A practical implementation records the versions involved in each important run and defines a rollback boundary. The learner should be able to answer not only what the system did, but which artifact versions caused it to behave that way.

### 8. Traces

The final production question for Observability is whether the mechanism improves the business outcome enough to justify its operational cost. A technically elegant system can still be a poor product if it is too slow, too expensive, too difficult to monitor, or too risky. For traces, compare the mechanism with a simpler baseline. State the baseline, measurable improvement, new failure modes, and operational burden. Use the simplest architecture that meets the requirement, and add complexity only when evidence shows that the additional capability creates value.

## Production design and operational readiness

### 1. Observability

The first principle for Observability is to make the boundary explicit. A production implementation should state what enters the component, what leaves it, what state it may mutate, what policy constrains it, and what evidence proves that the operation succeeded. When those boundaries are hidden inside a framework, failures become difficult to localize. In this module, observability should therefore be treated as an engineering contract rather than a collection of API calls.

## Mastery gate

Completion means being able to explain the mechanism from first principles, implement the smallest working version, deliberately break it, identify the first failing boundary from evidence, repair it, measure the repaired system against a baseline, and defend the resulting trade-offs. The learner should also explain when not to use the mechanism. Production expertise includes recognizing when a simpler deterministic solution is safer, cheaper and easier to operate.

## Deep case study 1: Observability

Consider an enterprise workload in which observability is a material part of the decision path. Start by stating the business outcome, users, data boundary, expected action, and failure cost. Establish a baseline before introducing the module mechanism. Then define the smallest implementation that demonstrates it. Instrument the boundary so a reviewer can see inputs, intermediate state, decisions, outputs, latency and resource usage without exposing secrets or unnecessary personal data. Introduce one controlled failure at a time: malformed input, missing evidence, stale state, dependency timeout, authorization mismatch, contradictory data, unexpected model output, or policy change. For each failure, identify the first observable deviation from the expected contract. Do not jump directly to a fix; write a hypothesis and run an experiment that distinguishes it from competing explanations. After the fix, replay the same failure and verify that the regression test protects the boundary. Finally, compare the improved implementation with the baseline on task success, latency, cost and operational complexity. A strong design review should explain why the architecture is sufficient, which alternatives were rejected, what evidence supports the decision, and what future observation would justify revisiting it.

This case also illustrates why observability cannot be delegated blindly to a language model. If the model produces an incorrect recommendation, the surrounding application must still enforce authorization, budget, data access, and verification. Where an action is irreversible or high impact, introduce an approval boundary or deterministic verifier. Where information is uncertain, represent uncertainty rather than manufacturing confidence. Where knowledge can become stale, record versions and effective dates. Where the workload is multi-tenant, apply tenant isolation before candidate truncation or action selection. Where the system is long-running, persist state and make side effects idempotent. These controls are the engineering environment in which the module mechanism becomes trustworthy.

## Deep case study 2: Traces

Consider an enterprise workload in which traces is a material part of the decision path. Start by stating the business outcome, users, data boundary, expected action, and failure cost.

Do not jump directly to a fix; write a hypothesis and run an experiment that distinguishes it from competing explanations. After the fix, replay the same failure and verify that the regression test protects the boundary. Finally, compare the improved implementation with the baseline on task success, latency, cost and operational complexity. A strong design review should explain why the architecture is sufficient, which alternatives were rejected, what evidence supports the decision, and what future observation would justify revisiting it.

This case also illustrates why cost attribution cannot be delegated blindly to a language model. If the model produces an incorrect recommendation, the surrounding application must still enforce authorization, budget, data access, and verification. Where an action is irreversible or high impact, introduce an approval boundary or deterministic verifier. Where information is uncertain, represent uncertainty rather than manufacturing confidence. Where knowledge can become stale, record versions and effective dates. Where the workload is multi-tenant, apply tenant isolation before candidate truncation or action selection. Where the system is long-running, persist state and make side effects idempotent. These controls are the engineering environment in which the module mechanism becomes trustworthy.

Consider an enterprise workload in which traces is a material part of the decision path. Start by stating the business outcome, users, data boundary, expected action, and failure cost. Establish a baseline before introducing the module mechanism. Then define the smallest implementation that demonstrates it. Instrument the boundary so a reviewer can see inputs, intermediate state, decisions, outputs, latency and resource usage without exposing secrets or unnecessary personal data. Introduce one controlled failure at a time: malformed input, missing evidence, stale state, dependency timeout, authorization mismatch, contradictory data, unexpected model output, or policy change. For each failure, identify the first observable deviation from the expected contract. Do not jump directly to a fix; write a hypothesis and run an experiment that distinguishes it from competing explanations. After the fix, replay the same failure and verify that the regression test protects the boundary. Finally, compare the improved implementation with the baseline on task success, latency, cost and operational complexity. A strong design review should explain why the architecture is sufficient, which alternatives were rejected, what evidence supports the decision, and what future observation would justify revisiting it.

This case also illustrates why traces cannot be delegated blindly to a language model. If the model produces an incorrect recommendation, the surrounding application must still enforce authorization, budget, data access, and verification. Where an action is irreversible or high impact, introduce an approval boundary or deterministic verifier. Where information is uncertain, represent uncertainty rather than manufacturing confidence. Where knowledge can become stale, record versions and effective dates. Where the workload is multi-tenant, apply tenant isolation before candidate truncation or action selection. Where the system is long-running, persist state and make side effects idempotent. These controls are the engineering environment in which the module mechanism becomes trustworthy.
