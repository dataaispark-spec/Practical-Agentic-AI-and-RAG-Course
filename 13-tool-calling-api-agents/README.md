# Module 13 — Tool Calling + API Agents


## Mission
Turn an LLM from a text generator into a controlled system that can request real operations through typed, validated and authorized tools.

## Mental model
```text
User goal
  ↓
Model decides whether a tool is needed
  ↓
Tool call schema
  ↓
Validation
  ↓
Policy / authorization
  ↓
Idempotency + budget checks
  ↓
Tool execution
  ↓
Structured tool result
  ↓
Model continues
```

The model **requests** an action. Application code decides whether that action is permitted and how it executes.

## Learning outcomes
Build a framework-free tool runtime supporting:
- typed tool schemas;
- tool registration/discovery;
- argument validation;
- deterministic authorization;
- risk classification;
- idempotency;
- timeout/retry behavior;
- structured errors;
- audit events;
- tool-result contracts;
- human approval for high-impact actions.

## Tool contract
Every tool should define:
- name;
- description;
- input schema;
- output schema;
- risk class;
- required permissions;
- timeout;
- retry policy;
- idempotency policy;
- audit requirements.

## Tool categories
### Read-only
Search, retrieve, calculate, inspect status.

### Reversible write
Create draft, update a non-critical record, schedule a reversible operation.

### Irreversible/high-impact
Transfer funds, delete data, send external communication, change production configuration. These require deterministic policy and usually approval.

## Labs
### Lab 1 — Tool registry
Register `search_customer`, `get_order`, `calculate_refund` and `create_refund` with typed contracts.

### Lab 2 — Schema validation
Reject missing, extra, wrong-type and out-of-range arguments.

### Lab 3 — Tool selection
Given 20 natural-language requests, classify which tool is appropriate and create a gold decision set.

### Lab 4 — Authorization
Create roles such as support-agent, manager and finance-admin. Prove unauthorized calls fail before execution.

### Lab 5 — Risk gates
Require human approval for refunds above a threshold and all irreversible operations.

### Lab 6 — Idempotency
Send the same tool request twice. Prove that the side effect happens once.

### Lab 7 — Timeout/retry
Inject transient and permanent failures. Retry only retryable failures and preserve the original request ID.

### Lab 8 — Structured errors
Return machine-readable errors such as `VALIDATION_ERROR`, `NOT_FOUND`, `POLICY_DENIED`, `RATE_LIMITED` and `UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT`.

### Lab 9 — Tool injection
Put malicious instructions inside a tool result. Demonstrate that tool output is untrusted data and cannot override system policy.

### Lab 10 — Complete Data Agent
Build an agent that searches customer/order data, reasons over the results, and requests a refund only when policy permits.

## Detailed exercises
1. Design a JSON schema for a financial transfer.
2. Add enum validation for risk levels.
3. Build a registry lookup by tool name.
4. Implement permission checks.
5. Implement idempotency keys.
6. Add timeout handling.
7. Add exponential retry with bounded attempts.
8. Add structured audit records.
9. Add approval state persistence.
10. Prevent a model from directly executing arbitrary Python.
11. Create a malicious tool result and test policy isolation.
12. Build a tool simulator for 100 generated calls.
13. Measure tool success/error/latency rates.
14. Build a deterministic fallback when a tool is unavailable.
15. Design tool version compatibility.

## Failure-first exercises
- malformed JSON arguments;
- unknown tool name;
- unauthorized tool;
- stale resource ID;
- duplicate delivery;
- partial upstream failure;
- timeout after side effect;
- malicious tool output;
- excessive tool-call loop;
- tool result larger than context budget.

## Tool-call loop
```text
OBSERVE state
 ↓
DECIDE tool or answer
 ↓
VALIDATE request
 ↓
POLICY CHECK
 ↓
APPROVAL if needed
 ↓
EXECUTE
 ↓
VERIFY result
 ↓
continue / stop
```

## Production requirements
- never expose unrestricted credentials to the model;
- keep secrets outside prompts/tool arguments;
- validate server-side even when the model generated a schema-valid call;
- enforce budgets outside the model;
- make writes idempotent where possible;
- record authorization decisions;
- separate tool identity from user identity;
- use least privilege;
- isolate tenants;
- verify side effects.

## Industry labs
**Banking:** account lookup + transaction simulation + approval-gated transfer.

**Healthcare:** patient-record search with role-based access and audit logging.

**Cybersecurity:** incident lookup + safe diagnostic actions + production-change approval.

**Manufacturing:** equipment telemetry + maintenance-ticket creation.

**Enterprise IT:** ticket search + knowledge retrieval + controlled remediation.

## Interview questions
1. What is tool calling?
2. Why are schemas necessary?
3. Who should enforce authorization?
4. Why can't model-generated JSON be trusted?
5. Explain idempotency.
6. How do you handle timeout-after-side-effect?
7. What should a tool result contain?
8. How do you secure credentials?
9. How do you prevent arbitrary tool execution?
10. How do you classify tool risk?
11. How do you design approval workflows?
12. How do you version tools?
13. How do you debug tool-selection failures?
14. How do you cap tool loops?
15. How would you test 1,000 tool calls?

## System-design challenge
Design a tool gateway serving 500 agents and 2,000 tools with strict tenant isolation, role-based authorization, approval workflows, rate limits, idempotency, auditability and p95 tool dispatch under 100 ms before upstream execution.

## Mastery gate
You pass when you can build a safe tool runtime without relying on the model to enforce policy, demonstrate duplicate/timeout recovery, and explain exactly where authorization, verification and audit happen.

## Google Colab
`notebooks/module_13_tool_calling.ipynb` is self-contained and implements typed tools, validation, authorization, risk gates, idempotency, failure injection and a mini Data Agent.

## Expanded long-form course chapter

This course is a practical engineering progression from deterministic software and LLM applications to retrieval, tools, stateful agents, distributed coordination, knowledge graphs, durable autonomy, verification, computer use, and controlled self-improvement. The governing idea is that an AI system becomes production-grade not by adding more model calls, but by adding explicit boundaries around probabilistic decisions. Throughout the 43 modules, the learner repeatedly asks: What is the goal? What state is authoritative? What evidence is available? What actions are permitted? What budget applies? What must be verified? What happens when a dependency fails? What must be observable and auditable? What evidence would justify changing the design?

The course uses the AegisAI mental model: Model + Harness + Environment + Tools + State + Policy + Budget + Verification. Retrieval is treated as a knowledge mechanism; an agent loop is treated as a decision-and-action mechanism; a harness is treated as the control plane around the model; and a verifier is treated as an independent check on outcomes. This distinction prevents a common engineering failure in which a prompt is asked to perform authorization, correctness checking, persistence, and business policy simultaneously.

Every module follows the same learning rhythm: Predict → Run → Observe → Explain → Break → Debug → Measure → Improve → Defend. The examples therefore emphasize observable mechanisms, explicit contracts, failure injection, metrics, and regression tests. The notebooks and applications are intended to work with deterministic fakes and synthetic data wherever possible, so that the learner can understand the mechanism before depending on a commercial provider.

## Module-specific learning contract

This expanded chapter deepens the repository canonical learning objectives for **Module 13: Tool Calling + API Agents**. The objective vocabulary is preserved: tool calling, tool schemas, authorization, idempotency, approval, and audit. Each concept is connected to architecture, implementation, failure analysis, evaluation, security, operations and system-design reasoning.

## First-principles concepts

### 1. Tool Calling

The first principle for Tool Calling + API Agents is to make the boundary explicit. A production implementation should state what enters the component, what leaves it, what state it may mutate, what policy constrains it, and what evidence proves that the operation succeeded. When those boundaries are hidden inside a framework, failures become difficult to localize. In this module, tool calling should therefore be treated as an engineering contract rather than a collection of API calls. A useful review asks which decisions are deterministic, which decisions are probabilistic, which data is trusted, and which observations are required to reconstruct a failed run.

### 2. Tool Schemas

A practical way to learn Tool Calling + API Agents is to start with the smallest executable mechanism and then add one production constraint at a time. Begin with a happy-path example for tool schemas; add typed inputs; introduce malformed input; introduce a dependency timeout; add a policy restriction; add telemetry; then replay the same scenario. This progression makes cause and effect visible. Do not add architecture merely because the technology is available. Add it when a measured requirement or failure mode justifies the complexity.

### 3. Authorization

In an enterprise setting, Tool Calling + API Agents rarely exists in isolation. Identity, tenancy, data classification, latency objectives, cost limits, audit requirements and operational ownership all change the design. A mechanism that works for a personal prototype may be unacceptable when the same request can cross a tenant boundary or trigger a financial action. The correct design combines the technical mechanism with deterministic controls outside the model. authorization becomes useful only when the surrounding system can enforce who may use it, what evidence it may access, what it may change, and how the result will be checked.

### 4. Idempotency

The failure-first perspective is especially important for Tool Calling + API Agents. A system that works on the happy path proves very little. The stronger question is what happens when input is incomplete, a dependency is slow, returned data is contradictory, a user disconnects, policy changes, state is stale, or an attacker deliberately supplies hostile content. For idempotency, define the expected observable before injecting the fault. Record the first failing stage, containment boundary, recovery action, and regression assertion. This converts debugging from intuition into an experiment.

### 5. Approval

Measurement should accompany every meaningful change to Tool Calling + API Agents. Quality, latency and cost are often coupled. Larger context may improve answer quality but increase latency and token cost. More retries may improve availability during short outages while amplifying load during a large outage. A stronger verifier may reduce unsafe actions while increasing response time. For approval, maintain a scorecard containing task success, relevant quality metrics, p50/p95 latency, resource consumption, failure rate, and policy or verification failures. The goal is to make trade-offs explicit.

### 6. Audit

A useful architecture diagram for Tool Calling + API Agents separates mechanism from control. The mechanism performs useful work; the control plane establishes identity, validates inputs, enforces authorization, manages budgets, records telemetry, and verifies outcomes. For audit, draw both layers. Ask whether the system would remain safe if the model produced a wrong answer. If not, a critical control is probably living in the wrong place. Production AI engineering moves irreversible decisions away from untrusted model output and toward deterministic policy, typed interfaces and independent verification.

### 7. Tool Calling

Versioning is part of the technical design of Tool Calling + API Agents, not an administrative afterthought. Prompts, models, embeddings, retrieval indexes, policies, tools, graph schemas, memory records and verifier rules can all change behavior. If tool calling changes without a version identifier, a later incident may be impossible to reproduce. A practical implementation records the versions involved in each important run and defines a rollback boundary. The learner should be able to answer not only what the system did, but which artifact versions caused it to behave that way.

### 8. Tool Schemas

The final production question for Tool Calling + API Agents is whether the mechanism improves the business outcome enough to justify its operational cost. A technically elegant system can still be a poor product if it is too slow, too expensive, too difficult to monitor, or too risky. For tool schemas, compare the mechanism with a simpler baseline. State the baseline, measurable improvement, new failure modes, and operational burden. Use the simplest architecture that meets the requirement, and add complexity only when evidence shows that the additional capability creates value.

A useful review asks which decisions are deterministic, which decisions are probabilistic, which data is trusted, and which observations are required to reconstruct a failed run.

### 2. Tool Schemas

A practical way to learn Tool Calling + API Agents is to start with the smallest executable mechanism and then add one production constraint at a time. Begin with a happy-path example for tool schemas; add typed inputs; introduce malformed input; introduce a dependency timeout; add a policy restriction; add telemetry; then replay the same scenario. This progression makes cause and effect visible. Do not add architecture merely because the technology is available. Add it when a measured requirement or failure mode justifies the complexity.

### 3. Authorization

In an enterprise setting, Tool Calling + API Agents rarely exists in isolation. Identity, tenancy, data classification, latency objectives, cost limits, audit requirements and operational ownership all change the design. A mechanism that works for a personal prototype may be unacceptable when the same request can cross a tenant boundary or trigger a financial action. The correct design combines the technical mechanism with deterministic controls outside the model. authorization becomes useful only when the surrounding system can enforce who may use it, what evidence it may access, what it may change, and how the result will be checked.

### 4. Idempotency

The failure-first perspective is especially important for Tool Calling + API Agents. A system that works on the happy path proves very little. The stronger question is what happens when input is incomplete, a dependency is slow, returned data is contradictory, a user disconnects, policy changes, state is stale, or an attacker deliberately supplies hostile content. For idempotency, define the expected observable before injecting the fault. Record the first failing stage, containment boundary, recovery action, and regression assertion. This converts debugging from intuition into an experiment.

### 5. Approval

Measurement should accompany every meaningful change to Tool Calling + API Agents. Quality, latency and cost are often coupled. Larger context may improve answer quality but increase latency and token cost. More retries may improve availability during short outages while amplifying load during a large outage. A stronger verifier may reduce unsafe actions while increasing response time. For approval, maintain a scorecard containing task success, relevant quality metrics, p50/p95 latency, resource consumption, failure rate, and policy or verification failures. The goal is to make trade-offs explicit.

### 6. Audit

A useful architecture diagram for Tool Calling + API Agents separates mechanism from control. The mechanism performs useful work; the control plane establishes identity, validates inputs, enforces authorization, manages budgets, records telemetry, and verifies outcomes. For audit, draw both layers. Ask whether the system would remain safe if the model produced a wrong answer. If not, a critical control is probably living in the wrong place. Production AI engineering moves irreversible decisions away from untrusted model output and toward deterministic policy, typed interfaces and independent verification.

### 7. Tool Calling

Versioning is part of the technical design of Tool Calling + API Agents, not an administrative afterthought. Prompts, models, embeddings, retrieval indexes, policies, tools, graph schemas, memory records and verifier rules can all change behavior. If tool calling changes without a version identifier, a later incident may be impossible to reproduce. A practical implementation records the versions involved in each important run and defines a rollback boundary. The learner should be able to answer not only what the system did, but which artifact versions caused it to behave that way.

### 8. Tool Schemas

The final production question for Tool Calling + API Agents is whether the mechanism improves the business outcome enough to justify its operational cost. A technically elegant system can still be a poor product if it is too slow, too expensive, too difficult to monitor, or too risky. For tool schemas, compare the mechanism with a simpler baseline. State the baseline, measurable improvement, new failure modes, and operational burden. Use the simplest architecture that meets the requirement, and add complexity only when evidence shows that the additional capability creates value.

## Production design and operational readiness

A production implementation should state what enters the component, what leaves it, what state it may mutate, what policy constrains it, and what evidence proves that the operation succeeded.

## Mastery gate

Completion means being able to explain the mechanism from first principles, implement the smallest working version, deliberately break it, identify the first failing boundary from evidence, repair it, measure the repaired system against a baseline, and defend the resulting trade-offs. The learner should also explain when not to use the mechanism. Production expertise includes recognizing when a simpler deterministic solution is safer, cheaper and easier to operate.

## Deep case study 1: Tool Calling

Consider an enterprise workload in which tool calling is a material part of the decision path. Start by stating the business outcome, users, data boundary, expected action, and failure cost. Establish a baseline before introducing the module mechanism. Then define the smallest implementation that demonstrates it. Instrument the boundary so a reviewer can see inputs, intermediate state, decisions, outputs, latency and resource usage without exposing secrets or unnecessary personal data. Introduce one controlled failure at a time: malformed input, missing evidence, stale state, dependency timeout, authorization mismatch, contradictory data, unexpected model output, or policy change. For each failure, identify the first observable deviation from the expected contract. Do not jump directly to a fix; write a hypothesis and run an experiment that distinguishes it from competing explanations. After the fix, replay the same failure and verify that the regression test protects the boundary. Finally, compare the improved implementation with the baseline on task success, latency, cost and operational complexity. A strong design review should explain why the architecture is sufficient, which alternatives were rejected, what evidence supports the decision, and what future observation would justify revisiting it.

This case also illustrates why tool calling cannot be delegated blindly to a language model. If the model produces an incorrect recommendation, the surrounding application must still enforce authorization, budget, data access, and verification. Where an action is irreversible or high impact, introduce an approval boundary or deterministic verifier. Where information is uncertain, represent uncertainty rather than manufacturing confidence. Where knowledge can become stale, record versions and effective dates. Where the workload is multi-tenant, apply tenant isolation before candidate truncation or action selection. Where the system is long-running, persist state and make side effects idempotent. These controls are the engineering environment in which the module mechanism becomes trustworthy.

If the model produces an incorrect recommendation, the surrounding application must still enforce authorization, budget, data access, and verification.

## Deep case study 5: Approval

Consider an enterprise workload in which approval is a material part of the decision path. Start by stating the business outcome, users, data boundary, expected action, and failure cost. Establish a baseline before introducing the module mechanism. Then define the smallest implementation that demonstrates it. Instrument the boundary so a reviewer can see inputs, intermediate state, decisions, outputs, latency and resource usage without exposing secrets or unnecessary personal data. Introduce one controlled failure at a time: malformed input, missing evidence, stale state, dependency timeout, authorization mismatch, contradictory data, unexpected model output, or policy change. For each failure, identify the first observable deviation from the expected contract. Do not jump directly to a fix; write a hypothesis and run an experiment that distinguishes it from competing explanations. After the fix, replay the same failure and verify that the regression test protects the boundary. Finally, compare the improved implementation with the baseline on task success, latency, cost and operational complexity. A strong design review should explain why the architecture is sufficient, which alternatives were rejected, what evidence supports the decision, and what future observation would justify revisiting it.

Introduce one controlled failure at a time: malformed input, missing evidence, stale state, dependency timeout, authorization mismatch, contradictory data, unexpected model output, or policy change. For each failure, identify the first observable deviation from the expected contract. Do not jump directly to a fix; write a hypothesis and run an experiment that distinguishes it from competing explanations. After the fix, replay the same failure and verify that the regression test protects the boundary. Finally, compare the improved implementation with the baseline on task success, latency, cost and operational complexity. A strong design review should explain why the architecture is sufficient, which alternatives were rejected, what evidence supports the decision, and what future observation would justify revisiting it.

This case also illustrates why tool calling cannot be delegated blindly to a language model. If the model produces an incorrect recommendation, the surrounding application must still enforce authorization, budget, data access, and verification. Where an action is irreversible or high impact, introduce an approval boundary or deterministic verifier. Where information is uncertain, represent uncertainty rather than manufacturing confidence. Where knowledge can become stale, record versions and effective dates. Where the workload is multi-tenant, apply tenant isolation before candidate truncation or action selection. Where the system is long-running, persist state and make side effects idempotent. These controls are the engineering environment in which the module mechanism becomes trustworthy.
